# Arkanoid
A cool game which I created in OOP course during the seconed semester of my first year.
# Install
Download these files and run in your java IDE.
# How To Play
Your role is to control the paddle. Use the paddle to move the balls and save them from death. 
You can move the paddle left and right using the arrow keys.
Stay in control!
When all balls lost you are dead.
